NewsClip Assessment - VW Car Stock

Assumptions:
- Normally we'd obviously need some sort of security so that only authorised users can access the system. These users would also have various security rights. Assuming that this is all already dealt with when loading the web page...
- The Car object refers to a Car 'Type' and not individual cars as stock items. If it was required to consider individual cars (and their unique attributes such as a registration number), this would've been slightly different
- CarStock is how we control add stock and remove stock for a specific car
